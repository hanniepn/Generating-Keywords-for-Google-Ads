Project Description
Hypothesis: I would work for a digital marketing agency, approached by a large online furniture retailer. I was tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for a search campaign for their sofa section. With my Python skills, I will create these keywords efficiently.
The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
